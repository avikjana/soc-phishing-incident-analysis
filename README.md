Phishing Email Incident Report

(ISO/IEC 27001 & ISO/IEC 27035 Aligned)

Overview

This repository presents a professional phishing email investigation conducted using internationally accepted information security and incident response standards. The analysis follows ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management and ISO/IEC 27035 for incident handling, reflecting real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) practices.

The project is intended to demonstrate practical skills in phishing detection, technical analysis, and structured security documentation.

Objective

Investigate a suspected phishing email
