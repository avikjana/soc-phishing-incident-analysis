Sending Infrastructure

Originating IP: 209.85.220.41

ASN: AS15169

Organization: Google LLC

Network: 209.85.128.0/17

RIR: ARIN

Country: United States

📌 Successful SPF, DKIM, and DMARC confirm no spoofing or domain impersonation.

5. Threat Intelligence Correlation

VirusTotal Summary

Detection Ratio: 1 / 95

Community Score: -33

Majority Verdict: Clean

Flagging Context: Historical phishing and spam campaigns abusing Gmail accounts, not malicious infrastructure ownership

Key SOC Interpretation (Important):

Google mail IPs are shared infrastructure

Abuse reports relate to individual compromised Gmail accounts

IP reputation alone is not sufficient for malicious classification

6. Content Analysis

Email Body:

“That is Jessi Anderson Avik.”

No social engineering language

No urgency, financial request, or credential lure

No attachments or URLs

No impersonation attempt detected

7. Risk Assessment (ISO/IEC 27005)
Risk Category	Assessment
Phishing Risk	Low
Malware Risk	None
Credential Theft	None
User Impact	Minimal

Overall Risk Rating: 🟢 LOW

8. Decision & SOC Rationale

Final Classification: ✅ Legitimate Email (Low Risk)

Decision Rationale:

Authentication controls fully passed

Infrastructure belongs to trusted provider (Google)

No malicious content or indicators present

Threat intelligence flags are contextual and historical

📌 This case demonstrates proper SOC triage and avoidance of false positives.

9. Recommended Action

No blocking or containment required

Monitor only if sender behavior changes

User awareness: unsolicited ≠ malicious
